    image: '/images/workimages/turflo/turflo.png',
    category: 'Mobile Design',
    year: '2025',
    client: 'Turflo',
    duration: '12 months',
    role: 'Design System Lead',
    team: 'Design Team (6), Frontend Engineers (4), Product Managers (2)',
    overview: 'TURFLO is India’s all-in-one sports community and turf‑booking platform. It enables users to discover local courts and fields, view real-time availability, make instant reservations (no commission for venues), manage player lineups, chat, RSVP for matches, and track performance via dynamic player cards & achievements.',
    challenge: 'The primary challenge in designing Turflo was to make the product intuitive for both casual players and frequent organizers. The original booking process users were used to often involved back-and-forth calls, payment confusion, and lack of availability transparency. We had to rethink the entire flow—minimizing the number of steps while maintaining clarity. Another major consideration was building tools that worked smoothly for both sides of the platform: users and turf owners.',
    solution: 'CI led the design from scratch, starting with user research to understand pain points, followed by detailed wireframes, prototypes, and final UI that aligned with both usability and brand vision. The design emphasized minimal steps to book, easy login options, clean navigation, and clear CTAs. We also worked on branding, visual hierarchy, and a color palette that felt energetic yet professional, fitting the sports vibe.',
    outcome: 'As the product is currently in the testing phase, early user feedback has been promising. Users have responded positively to the simplicity of the booking flow and the overall look and feel of the app. Internal testing has also shown improved user task completion times and lower friction in onboarding. We are actively gathering data, iterating on features, and fine-tuning the product for a successful public launch.',

    title: 'Turflo Partner',
    summary: 'Community-driven platform with advanced interaction features',
    image: '/images/workimages/turflopartner/turflopartner.png',
    category: 'Mobile Design',
    year: '2025',
    client: 'Turflo',
    duration: '1 Year',
    role: 'Lead Product Designer',
    team: 'Product Manager, 5 Engineers, Community Manager',
    overview: 'Turflo Partner Application is a powerful companion platform built exclusively for turf owners and managers to take complete control over their operations. While the main Turflo app focuses on user bookings, the partner application serves as the backend hub where venue partners can manage everything from daily bookings to long-term performance insights—all in real time.',
    challenge: 'One of the biggest challenges was designing a system that could simplify complex turf management without making it feel like a heavy-duty admin panel. Most turf owners previously managed bookings through calls, Excel sheets, or unstructured WhatsApp messages. We needed to build a platform that would feel intuitive even for those with limited tech exposure, yet be robust enough to offer advanced tools like earnings tracking, ad campaign management, and booking analytics.',
    solution: 'I worked closely on the product strategy, user flows, and UI/UX design for the partner app. We focused on visual clarity, with modular dashboard elements that showed key metrics like today’s bookings, cancellations, income trends, and turf occupancy. Features such as instant booking approvals, calendar views, analytics, customer insights, and even in-app ad promotions were designed to be just a tap away. The branding followed the same energetic yet trustworthy tone of the main app to keep consistency across the ecosystem.',
    outcome: 'In its current testing phase, the partner app has received encouraging feedback from turf owners during closed trials. Many highlighted how easy it is to track bookings and earnings at a glance, and appreciated having a centralized system to handle tasks that previously required multiple platforms. We are continuing to gather feedback, optimize workflows, and refine advanced features like in-app ad placements and automated customer insights before the full-scale rollout.',

    year: '2025',
    client: 'UrCompanion',
    duration: '4 months',
    role: 'Lead Product Designer',
    team: 'Product Manager, 5 Engineers, Community Manager',
    overview: 'UrCompanion is a mental wellness platform designed to support individuals dealing with stress, anxiety, depression, or emotional distress by connecting them with trained experts and empathetic peers. The core idea behind the product was to create a safe, non-judgmental, and easily accessible space for users to seek help, share experiences, and receive real-time support through private sessions.',
    challenge: 'The challenge was to build an emotionally sensitive platform that didn’t feel clinical or intimidating. Mental health users are highly vulnerable, and even small design missteps can increase drop-off or worsen hesitation. The booking process needed to feel calming and straightforward, while still ensuring secure, professional connections with verified experts and support peers. We also needed to make users feel they were never alone, with community features that didn’t compromise privacy.',
    solution: 'I was deeply involved in the product design journey—from understanding user mindsets and pain points, to creating the full UX flow, UI system, and brand identity. The design focused on warmth, simplicity, and trust. Booking a session with a counselor or peer was made as smooth as possible — with clear profiles, time slots, and gentle language cues. Visuals were soft, friendly, and focused on emotional comfort. Features like progress tracking, chat before sessions, and expert verification were introduced to enhance trust and engagement.',
    outcome: 'Though the product is still in testing, early feedback from users has been powerful. Many have shared that the interface feels “safe and comforting,” and the booking flow gave them a sense of control over their healing journey. We are actively iterating based on pilot users input to refine accessibility, onboarding ease, and feature depth — ensuring UrCompanion becomes a truly impactful mental health companion at launch.',

    category: 'Mobile Design',
    year: '2022',
    client: 'Community Connect',
    duration: '9 months',
    role: 'Lead Product Designer',
    team: 'Product Manager, 5 Engineers, Community Manager',
    overview: 'UrCompanion Partner Application is the professional-facing platform designed for mental health experts, wellness coaches, and peer supporters who offer guidance through the UrCompanion ecosystem. It enables counselors to manage their sessions, interact with users, create wellness content, host live meditation classes, and track their performance—all from one dedicated dashboard.',
    challenge: 'The main challenge was to build a workspace that felt both professional and mindful. Mental wellness professionals need tools that are efficient, organized, and data-driven, but without the cold, corporate feel of traditional dashboards. We needed to strike the right balance between productivity and empathy—making sure therapists could manage their schedules, earnings, and content creation with ease, while still being reminded of the human impact behind every session.',
    solution: 'I led the UX and interface design, ensuring the partner app reflected the calm, compassionate ethos of the main user-facing platform. We introduced clear scheduling tools, real-time booking notifications, analytics for session performance and earnings, and a course builder where experts could publish guided wellness journeys or live group sessions like mindfulness and meditation. Visual cues were kept soft and purposeful, with an interface that encouraged clarity and focus without feeling clinical.',
    outcome: 'During the testing phase, early feedback from therapists and partners has been very promising. Many appreciated the ability to manage bookings and earnings in a transparent way, while also contributing meaningfully through custom content and classes. We are currently refining the experience based on pilot usage—focusing on streamlining session history, improving calendar integrations, and enhancing the course creation workflow to make the partner app a powerful tool for healing professionals.',
